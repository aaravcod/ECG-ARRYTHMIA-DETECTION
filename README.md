# ECG-ARRYTHMIA-DETECTION

Cardiac arrhythmias or irregularities in the heartbeat pose significant health risks including sudden cardiac arrest and stroke. Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial to mitigating these risks, yet traditional diagnostic methods often rely on manual interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals by trained medical professionals. This approach can be time-consuming, error-prone, and infeasible for large-scale or real-time diagnosis. 
This project aims to address these challenges by developing a machine learning-based system that automates arrhythmia detection using ECG data. The system will classify heartbeats into five distinct categories: normal (N), supraventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V), fusion (F), and unknown (Q). Such a system can serve as a decision-support tool for healthcare professionals, improving diagnosis accuracy and reducing diagnostic workload.
